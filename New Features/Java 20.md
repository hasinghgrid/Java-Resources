# 🌟 Java 20 Features

Java 20 (released in March 2023) focuses on preview and incubator features that improve productivity, concurrency, and pattern matching.

---

## 🧵 1. Virtual Threads (Second Preview)

**✨ Purpose:**

* Lightweight threads for highly concurrent applications.

**💡 Example:**

```java
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello from a virtual thread!"));
}
```

**✅ Advantages:**

* Supports millions of concurrent tasks with minimal memory.
* Simplifies concurrency code.

**⚠️ Earlier Alternative:**

* Traditional `Thread` objects or thread pools.

---

## 🔄 2. Structured Concurrency (Second Incubator)

**✨ Purpose:**

* Treat multiple tasks as a single unit for better error handling and lifecycle management.

**💡 Example:**

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> f1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataA());
    Future<String> f2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataB());
    scope.join();
    System.out.println(f1.resultNow() + " " + f2.resultNow());
}
```

**✅ Advantages:**

* Easier management of multiple concurrent tasks.
* Reduces boilerplate code.

**⚠️ Earlier Alternative:**

* Manual management of threads and Futures.

---

## 🔍 3. Record Patterns (Third Preview)

**✨ Purpose:**

* Simplify destructuring of record objects in `switch` or `if` statements.

**💡 Example:**

```java
record Point(int x, int y) {}

Point p = new Point(5, 10);
if (p instanceof Point(int a, int b)) {
    System.out.println("X: " + a + ", Y: " + b);
}
```

**✅ Advantages:**

* Cleaner, readable code for extracting record fields.

**⚠️ Earlier Alternative:**

* Manual getter calls.

---

## ⚡ 4. Pattern Matching for `switch` (Second Preview)

**✨ Purpose:**

* Combine pattern matching with switch expressions for type-safe branching.

**💡 Example:**

```java
Object obj = new Point(2, 3);
switch(obj) {
    case Point(int x, int y) -> System.out.println("X: " + x + ", Y: " + y);
    default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
}
```

**✅ Advantages:**

* Type-safe, concise multi-branch logic.

**⚠️ Earlier Alternative:**

* Nested `if-else` with type checks and casting.

---

## 🌐 5. Foreign Function & Memory API (Fourth Incubator)

**✨ Purpose:**

* Continue improving interaction with native code safely and efficiently.

**✅ Advantages:**

* Safe alternative to JNI.
* Cleaner syntax and better performance.
