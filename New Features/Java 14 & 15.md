# Java 14 – Major Features, Why Introduced, and Examples

---

## 1. Records (Preview)

* **Need**: Writing simple data carrier classes required a lot of boilerplate (constructors, getters, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`).
* **Feature**: `record` keyword introduced for concise immutable data classes.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  record Point(int x, int y) {}

  Point p = new Point(5, 10);
  System.out.println(p.x()); // 5
  ```
* **Benefit**: Automatically provides boilerplate code, reduces errors, and makes intent clear.

---

## 2. Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Preview)

* **Need**: After using `instanceof`, explicit casting was always required.
* **Feature**: Pattern matching allows binding the type directly.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  Object obj = "Hello";
  if (obj instanceof String s) {
      System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
  }
  ```
* **Benefit**: Reduces redundancy and improves readability.

---

## 3. Helpful NullPointerExceptions

* **Need**: Standard NPE messages didn’t show which variable was null, making debugging hard.
* **Feature**: JVM now provides more descriptive NPE messages.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  String s = null;
  s.length(); // JVM message: "Cannot invoke \"String.length()\" because \"s\" is null"
  ```
* **Benefit**: Easier debugging and faster resolution of errors.

---

## 4. Switch Expressions (Standardized)

* **Need**: After being previewed in Java 12 and 13, switch expressions were ready for production.
* **Feature**: `switch` expressions became a standard feature.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  int day = 2;
  String type = switch (day) {
      case 1, 7 -> "Weekend";
      default -> "Weekday";
  };
  ```
* **Benefit**: More powerful and concise switch usage.

---

## 5. Foreign-Memory Access API (Incubator)

* **Need**: Accessing off-heap/native memory was unsafe and complex with `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
* **Feature**: Introduced Foreign-Memory Access API with `MemorySegment` and `MemoryAddress`.
* **Benefit**: Safer and more efficient memory access outside the JVM heap.

---

## 6. JFR Event Streaming

* **Need**: Java Flight Recorder (JFR) profiling was static and lacked real-time streaming.
* **Feature**: Event streaming API added for real-time JVM monitoring.
* **Benefit**: Better observability and diagnostics in production.

---

## ✅ Summary of Java 14

Java 14 introduced **big productivity enhancements (records, pattern matching, helpful NPEs, switch expressions)** and **runtime improvements (foreign memory access, JFR streaming)**, marking a step toward more modern, concise, and safer Java.

# Java 15 – Major Features, Why Introduced, and Examples

---

## 1. Text Blocks (Standard)

* **Need**: Multi-line string support previewed in Java 13 now became a permanent feature.
* **Feature**: Text blocks (`"""`) standardized for multi-line strings.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  String html = """
      <html>
        <body>Hello</body>
      </html>
      """;
  ```
* **Benefit**: Simplifies handling of JSON, SQL, HTML, XML, and improves readability.

---

## 2. Sealed Classes (Preview)

* **Need**: Restricting which classes can extend/implement a class/interface was only enforceable via documentation or runtime checks.
* **Feature**: `sealed`, `non-sealed`, and `permits` keywords introduced.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}
  final class Circle implements Shape {}
  non-sealed class Rectangle implements Shape {}
  ```
* **Benefit**: Stronger control over inheritance, improves API design.

---

## 3. Hidden Classes

* **Need**: Frameworks (like proxies, bytecode generators) needed to define classes dynamically without polluting the public API.
* **Feature**: Hidden classes introduced, loadable but not discoverable via reflection.
* **Benefit**: Improves security and supports dynamic frameworks.

---

## 4. Records (Second Preview)

* **Need**: Based on feedback from Java 14, records were enhanced further.
* **Feature**: Refinements to records preview feature.
* **Benefit**: More stability and maturity before becoming standard in Java 16.

---

## 5. Foreign-Memory Access API (Second Incubator)

* **Need**: Continuous improvement of safe off-heap memory access.
* **Feature**: Enhanced memory access APIs.
* **Benefit**: Safer and more efficient interoperability with native code.

---

## 6. ZGC Improvements

* **Need**: Z Garbage Collector was introduced earlier but needed enhancements.
* **Feature**: ZGC extended to work with more use cases and reduced pause times.
* **Benefit**: Scales better with large heaps, improved performance.

---

## ✅ Summary of Java 15

Java 15 focused on **language improvements (text blocks standardized, sealed classes preview, records refined)** and **runtime/JVM enhancements (hidden classes, ZGC, foreign memory API)**. It laid groundwork for safer APIs and better framework support.
