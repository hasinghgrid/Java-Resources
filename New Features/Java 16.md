# Java 16 – Major Features, Why Introduced, and Examples

---

## 1. Records (Standard)

* **Need**: Records previewed in Java 14 and 15 are now standardized.
* **Feature**: `record` keyword for immutable data carriers.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  record Employee(String name, int id) {}

  Employee e = new Employee("Alice", 101);
  System.out.println(e.name()); // Alice
  ```
* **Benefit**: Eliminates boilerplate, enforces immutability.

---

## 2. Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Standard)

* **Need**: Previously previewed in Java 14, now standardized.
* **Feature**: Combines `instanceof` check and type cast.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  Object obj = "Hello";
  if (obj instanceof String s) {
      System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
  }
  ```
* **Benefit**: Cleaner, more concise code.

---

## 3. `Stream.toList()`

* **Need**: Converting streams to lists required `Collectors.toList()`.
* **Feature**: Direct `toList()` method added.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  List<Integer> list = Stream.of(1, 2, 3).toList();
  ```
* **Benefit**: Simpler syntax, improved readability.

---

## 4. Sealed Classes (Second Preview)

* **Need**: Refinements after Java 15 feedback.
* **Feature**: Continued preview of sealed classes.
* **Benefit**: More stable design for controlled inheritance.

---

## 5. Vector API (Incubator)

* **Need**: High-performance computing required **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** support.
* **Feature**: Vector API introduced for parallel numeric computations.
* **Benefit**: Better performance in data-intensive workloads.

---

## 6. Foreign Linker API (Incubator)

* **Need**: Interfacing with native libraries (`JNI`) was complex.
* **Feature**: Foreign Linker API simplifies calling native functions.
* **Benefit**: Safer, faster, and more convenient native interoperability.

---

## 7. Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals

* **Need**: Many applications relied on internal, unsupported JDK APIs.
* **Feature**: By default, JDK internal APIs are strongly encapsulated.
* **Benefit**: Encourages use of official APIs, improves security and maintainability.

## ✅ Summary of Java 16

Java 16 was a **stabilization release**, standardizing **records and pattern matching**, while continuing previews of **sealed classes** and introducing incubators like **Vector API** and **Foreign Linker API**. It also strengthened JDK integrity by encapsulating internals.
